# Product Specifications

### Turning Ideas into Action

> üí°**`Objective:`** Product Specifications power the coordinated fulfillment of **business outcomes** in our agile environment. Product managers' **core responsibility** is to align stakeholders and pull together a set of **structured directives** that provide **clarity** **&** **context**  for Program Increments (PI) deliverables.
>
> ‚úÖ **`Success Outcome` ** Deliver actionable definitions of feature(s) and specifically **to get features into the program backlog**.

*Updated:* `Feb 4 2022`

üí¨ Taylor [Comment]: 

My thought was that we would delete the "‚öôÔ∏è Instructions" from the final versions. Those are intended to help the PMs orient themselves but not stay in the communications we send out as it adds unnessary noise.

However, I think that the "üí° Objective" and "‚úÖ Success Outcome" sections should stay in all versions.

> ‚öôÔ∏è**`Instructions:`**At a high level, the chart below is to **visualize the progress** of the product spec work. Each stage needs to have **definitions of done** that we agree upon as a team and is understood by stakeholders. As we complete each portion of the spec work, [**update the nodes ‚Ü≥**](./Mermaid JS Charts.md) in the chart to green.

üí¨ Taylor [Comment]:

We shouldn't have any "Lorem ipsum" text. That's placeholder and needs to be filled out details around the specification process.

e.g., 
- "Met with compliance this week to do discovery for acceptance criteria and plan to have finalized and approved AC by end of week."
- ""
```

## Roadmap

> ‚öôÔ∏è**`Instructions:`**Use the "Now", "Next", "Later" categories to communicate a high-level roadmap and help stakeholders understand where each concept, feature, or capability fits into the list. **Now** is everthing  that is being worked on in the current PI. **Next** is what we hope to get into the following PI. **Later** is everything else. PIs in this chart are set to be 10 weeks.  [**Set the date ‚Ü≥**](./Mermaid JS Charts.md) of the "Now" PI, and the timeline (along with the red indicator) will automtically update.
